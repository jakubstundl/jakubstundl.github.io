          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Multiplayer zombie shooting game. There are different kinds of
            monsters, weapons and other accessories. Game is divided into levels
            to increase the difficulty with the progress.
          </p>

          <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
          <p>
            To achieve mlutiplayer, the game is fully server-authoritative. The
            game is played on backend where clients only send moving
            intructions. All movement instructions are calculated and then all
            coordinates are broadcast to all clients.
          </p>
          <h3>Movement</h3>
          <p>
            The movement works in 8 directions. Pressing or releasing one of
            four movement keys (wsad) changes the react component state. This
            action triggers the useEffect hook and sends the data to the
            backend.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>Object shape sent to the backend:</p>
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/moveState.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Another component state is changed when the mouse cursor moves over
            the div, where the game is displayed. With simple math, the rotation
            of the player is caldulated from the mouse cursor position. Because
            the rotation state isn't really important for the game state and
            also to achieve move fluid experience, the client displays it's own
            rotation state instead of recieving the state from the backend,
            while other players' states are recieved from the backend.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>To get the rotation:</p>
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/mouseOverHandler.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Shooting</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on the weapon, there are two functions to handle shooting
            in the game. Gun equiped by the player can be manual or automat. If
            the gun is manual, every single bullet is released by a left mouse
            button click. There is a player rotation state sent to the backend
            to spawn the bullet. On the other hand, automat weapons work on
            shooting with holding the left mouse button. The backend starts to
            read player rotation state from the rotation hook used to rotate
            players.
          </p>
          <h3>Backend</h3>
          To maintain readability and scaling potential, I used OOP to handle
          the game logic. The main backend component is the class called
          Playground.
          <h4>Playground</h4>
          <p>
            The Playground itself holds all the other objects, calculates their
            positions and its state is displayed on the frontend for all
            players. There is a interval running in the Playground instance. On
            the interval tick, it iterates through all the players, monsters and
            bullets, calling their movement methods and then emitting the states
            of all to observable on endpoint to which clients are subscribed.
            Objects of the game are stored in Hashmaps.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/playgroundObjects.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The Playground class is responsible for spawning game objects,
            moving them, deleting them and changing levels. Clients can also
            send signal to the backend to pause the game. When this endpoint is
            triggered, the pause function is called on the playground, which
            stops the interval from running and the game state stops changing.
          </p>
          <h4>Player</h4>
          <p>
            It is the simplest object. The class has a few properties as it's
            input from the client, it's position, the speed it's moving,
            healthpoints and cash for buying guns.
          </p>
          <h4>Monsters</h4>
          <p>
            Monsters are instances of the class Enemy. It also has a few
            properties as hp, speed, damage but also angle and it's target to
            kill, collision size for bullets and cash recieved by a player when
            killed.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/monstersProperties.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            To initiate a Enemy instance, there is used and object from the
            array of monsters. The rest of the fields is generated by the
            playground class as for example coordinates where the monster should
            spawn.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/enemyConstructor.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            For the purpose of monsters walking on the map, the Playground is
            divided into tiles.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/grid.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            where 0 is available for every object. 1 is for walls, which is
            restricted for all. 2 is the out of the map and is restricted for
            players but available for monsters and bullets. Both monsters and
            players have functions to determine on which tile they are located.
            Monsters then need pathfindig to find the player. For pathfindig I
            used
            <a href="https://easystarjs.com/">easystarjs</a>. To use easystarjs,
            monster iterates through players on the Playground to find the
            closest player, then it calculates its tile and sets it as a start
            for the pathfinder and asks the player for its tile to set it as the
            destination. Easystarjs calculates the route and return an array of
            the tiles to the destination. Monster then calculates the direction
            to move while moving tile index when tile of pathfinder is reached.
            When the distance between the player and the monster is less then
            certain amount, the pathfinder is no longer called and the monster
            directly follows the player.
          </p>

          <h4>Bullet</h4>
          <p>
            When the player is shooting, it also sends information about the gun
            it is holding.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/gunsProperties.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            These information is passed to the BulletController class. Instance
            of this class is recieving data of players' rotation, it collects
            data about gun and sends all the information about the bullet to the
            Playground to spawn it. When the gun is automat, it sets up a timer
            according to the gun cadence to spawn bullets automatically. There
            is a BulletController instance for each player.
          </p>
          <p>Data for the BulletController:</p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/bulletData.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Bullets hold many atributes. It's spawn coordinates are taken from
            the Player object who fired them. Bullet has information of how fast
            to move and how far, how much hp to take from the target and how
            many monsters it can go through.
          </p>
          <p>Data for initiate an instance of the bullet:</p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/bulletConstructor.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            When the Playground sees and a monter with 0 or less hp, it gives
            the cash, which monster holds, to the owner of the last bullet the
            monster has been hit. There is a movement function for the bullet
            running at Playground interval. In this function the bullet changes
            it's coordinates according to its speed. While moving, it checks
            monsters positions and if the distance is less than monster's
            collision zone, it does damage. Each monster can recieve damage from
            one bullet only once and when the damage is done, bullet's counter
            of monsters to pierce goes down by one. Each bullet also has a
            lifespan. When the Playground sees the bullet's lifespan is less or
            equal to zero, it removes the bullet from the game. Bullet lifespan
            is decreased when moving. it is set to zero, when it can't pierce
            more monsters, and also set to zero when hit the wall.
          </p>
          <h4>Turret</h4>
          <p>
            With getting more and more cash in the game, players have an ability
            to build automatic turrets.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/turret.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The turret sends data to the playground to spawn its bullets.
            Monster cash is recieved by the turret builder.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/turret.gif" alt="" />

          <h3>Game constants</h3>
          <p>
            Besides the constants for game objecst like guns and mosters, I use
            whole set of constants to balance the game.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/gameConstants.png" alt="" />
          <h3>Game levels</h3>
          <p>
            Level data contain an array of monsters, which will be spawned and
            also how many monster can be present on the Playground at the time.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/levels.png" alt="" />
          <h3>Endpoints</h3>
          <p>
            As a framework above Nextsjs, there is used tRPC to handle the
            trafic. Here I will describe two endpoints.
          </p>
          <img src="assets/zombieAssault/trpc.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            The first endpoint uses tRPC mutate hook. The procedure is protected
            which means the user has to be authorized to acces this endpoint.
            The input method validates the incoming data and finaly it sends the
            data to Playground class along with the name of the player. <br />
            The second input is a subscription hook. It is a websocket
            implementation of this framework. The frontend hook is subscribed to
            this subscription. There is an observable sent to the subscribers,
            which listens to the Playground interval which updates the game
            state values.
