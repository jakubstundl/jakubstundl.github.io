          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>App to scrape data from a webpage.</p>
          <h3>What is being scraped...</h3>
          <p>
            Web <a href="https://coincodex.com">coindcodex</a> provides its own
            AI analysis to predict cryptocurency prices based on coin's previous
            in the past.
          </p>

            <img src="assets/cryptoScraper/etherForcast.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Why?</h3>
          <p>To make a list of coins and have all the data in one place.</p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/cryptoScraper/appScreen.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Scraping</h3>
          <p>
            To mine the data I used a puppeteer library. It uses chromium
            browser to visit the page. Then it is necesary to tell the puppeteer
            where the wanted data lies. We can use Xpath, which is a position of
            the element in the html tree or a CSS selector. Here I had to use a
            selector, because the page architecture didn't let puppeteer to find
            the element by the xPath.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/cryptoScraper/selector.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Database</h3>
          <p>When the data is scraped, it is sorted into the database.</p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/cryptoScraper/dbScheme.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Deployment</h3>
          <p>
            For my own purposes, I wanted to deploy the app on my raspberryPi4.
            To reach maximum compatibility I decided to dockerize the app. The
            problem with puppeteer running on docker is that its chromium
            doesn't work. The work around is to download standalone chromium and
            then connect it to the puppeteer.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/cryptoScraper/chromiumDockerInstall.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Then when puppeteer runs the browser, set the path to previsouly
            installed chromium and set arguments suitable for running in docker
            environment.

          <h3>How to automate scraping</h3>
          <p>
            I set the scraper to update the data twice a day. Sometimes the page
            isn't available, so every hour there is a timer that checks for
            empty coin data. For the updating I made suitable endpoints, that
            would run the updating process. On the raspberryPi4 osperating
            system I set a cron job to send request to the endpoint to trigger
            the updating.

          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Multiplayer zombie shooting game. There are different kinds of
            monsters, weapons and other accessories. Game is divided into levels
            to increase the difficulty with the progress.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/ezgif-4-c81d54d996.gif" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Multiplayer</h3>
          <p>
            To achieve mlutiplayer, the game is fully server-authoritative. The
            game is played on backend where clients only send moving
            intructions. All movement instructions are calculated and then all
            coordinates are broadcast to all clients.
          </p>
          <h3>Movement</h3>
          <p>
            The movement works in 8 directions. Pressing or releasing one of
            four movement keys (wsad) changes the react component state. This
            action triggers the useEffect hook and sends the data to the
            backend.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>Object shape sent to the backend:</p>
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="assets/zombieAssault/moveState.png" alt="" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Another component state is changed when the mouse cursor moves over
            the div, where the game is displayed. With simple math, the rotation
            of the player is caldulated from the mouse cursor position. Because
            the rotation state isn't really important for the game state and
            also to achieve move fluid experience, the client displays it's own
            rotation state instead of recieving the state from the backend,
            while other players' states are recieved from the backend.
          </p>
          <div>
            <p>To get the rotation:</p>
            <div class="imgContainer">
              <img src="assets/zombieAssault/mouseOverHandler.png" alt="" />
            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>Shooting</h3>
          <p>
            Depending on the weapon, there are two functions to handle shooting
            in the game. Gun equiped by the player can be manual or automat. If
            the gun is manual, every single bullet is released by a left mouse
            button click. There is a player rotation state sent to the backend
            to spawn the bullet. On the other hand, automat weapons work on
            shooting with holding the left mouse button. The backend starts to
            read player rotation state from the rotation hook used to rotate
            players.
          </p>
          <h3>Backend</h3>
          To maintain readability and scaling potential, I used OOP to handle
          the game logic. The main backend component is the class called
          Playground.
          <h4>Playground</h4>
          <p>
            The Playground itself holds all the other objects, calculates their
            positions and its state is displayed on the frontend for all
            players. There is a interval running in the Playground instance. On
            the interval tick, it iterates through all the players, monsters and
            bullets, calling their movement methods and then emitting the states
            of all to observable on endpoint to which clients are subscribed.
            Objects of the game are stored in Hashmaps.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/playgroundObjects.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The Playground class is responsible for spawning game objects,
            moving them, deleting them and changing levels. Clients can also
            send signal to the backend to pause the game. When this endpoint is
            triggered, the pause function is called on the playground, which
            stops the interval from running and the game state stops changing.
          </p>
          <h4>Player</h4>
          <p>
            It is the simplest object. The class has a few properties as it's
            input from the client, it's position, the speed it's moving,
            healthpoints and cash for buying guns.
          </p>
          <h4>Monsters</h4>
          <p>
            Monsters are instances of the class Enemy. It also has a few
            properties as hp, speed, damage but also angle and it's target to
            kill, collision size for bullets and cash recieved by a player when
            killed.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/monstersProperties.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            To initiate a Enemy instance, there is used and object from the
            array of monsters. The rest of the fields is generated by the
            playground class as for example coordinates where the monster should
            spawn.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/enemyConstructor.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            For the purpose of monsters walking on the map, the Playground is
            divided into tiles.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/grid.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            where 0 is available for every object. 1 is for walls, which is
            restricted for all. 2 is the out of the map and is restricted for
            players but available for monsters and bullets. Both monsters and
            players have functions to determine on which tile they are located.
            Monsters then need pathfindig to find the player. For pathfindig I
            used
            <a href="https://easystarjs.com/">easystarjs</a>. To use easystarjs,
            monster iterates through players on the Playground to find the
            closest player, then it calculates its tile and sets it as a start
            for the pathfinder and asks the player for its tile to set it as the
            destination. Easystarjs calculates the route and return an array of
            the tiles to the destination. Monster then calculates the direction
            to move while moving tile index when tile of pathfinder is reached.
            When the distance between the player and the monster is less then
            certain amount, the pathfinder is no longer called and the monster
            directly follows the player.
          </p>

          <h4>Bullet</h4>
          <p>
            When the player is shooting, it also sends information about the gun
            it is holding.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/gunsProperties.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            These information is passed to the BulletController class. Instance
            of this class is recieving data of players' rotation, it collects
            data about gun and sends all the information about the bullet to the
            Playground to spawn it. When the gun is automat, it sets up a timer
            according to the gun cadence to spawn bullets automatically. There
            is a BulletController instance for each player.
          </p>
          <p>Data for the BulletController:</p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/bulletData.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Bullets hold many atributes. It's spawn coordinates are taken from
            the Player object who fired them. Bullet has information of how fast
            to move and how far, how much hp to take from the target and how
            many monsters it can go through.
          </p>
          <p>Data for initiate an instance of the bullet:</p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/bulletConstructor.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            When the Playground sees and a monter with 0 or less hp, it gives
            the cash, which monster holds, to the owner of the last bullet the
            monster has been hit. There is a movement function for the bullet
            running at Playground interval. In this function the bullet changes
            it's coordinates according to its speed. While moving, it checks
            monsters positions and if the distance is less than monster's
            collision zone, it does damage. Each monster can recieve damage from
            one bullet only once and when the damage is done, bullet's counter
            of monsters to pierce goes down by one. Each bullet also has a
            lifespan. When the Playground sees the bullet's lifespan is less or
            equal to zero, it removes the bullet from the game. Bullet lifespan
            is decreased when moving. it is set to zero, when it can't pierce
            more monsters, and also set to zero when hit the wall.
          </p>
          <h4>Turret</h4>
          <p>
            With getting more and more cash in the game, players have an ability
            to build automatic turrets.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/turret.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The turret sends data to the playground to spawn its bullets.
            Monster cash is recieved by the turret builder.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/turret.gif" alt="" />
          </div>

          <h3>Game constants</h3>
          <p>
            Besides the constants for game objecst like guns and mosters, I use
            whole set of constants to balance the game.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/gameConstants.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Game levels</h3>
          <p>
            Level data contain an array of monsters, which will be spawned and
            also how many monster can be present on the Playground at the time.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/levels.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h3>Endpoints</h3>
          <p>
            As a framework above Nextsjs, there is used tRPC to handle the
            trafic. Here I will describe two endpoints.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/trpc.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            The first endpoint uses tRPC mutate hook. The procedure is protected
            which means the user has to be authorized to acces this endpoint.
            The input method validates the incoming data and finaly it sends the
            data to Playground class along with the name of the player. <br />
            The second endpoint is a subscription. It is a websocket
            implementation of this framework. The frontend hook is subscribed to
            this subscription. There is an observable sent to the subscribers,
            which listens to the Playground interval which updates the game
            state values.
          </p>
          <h3>Frontend</h3>
          <p>
            For the game display I used a div of width and height of the window.
            This div is in position relative having inside this huge div of the
            map in position absolute. The map div's offset from the left and top
            is changed according to player's coordinates. Player is kept in the
            middle of the screen. All the displayed information is saved in
            react's useState hooks which are updated by the subscription hooks
            of the websocket from the backend.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the corner there is also minimap, which takes the same data as
            actual map, but provides whole game overview. It displays players'
            positions and all the monsters.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/minimap.gif" alt="" />
          </div>
          <p>
            For painting the map or editing sprites I used graphical editor
            Krita.
          </p>
          <div class="imgContainer">
            <img src="assets/zombieAssault/krita.png" alt="" />
